<h3>Description of an AWS Service</h3>
<b>Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</b>
<p>S3 provides a secure, durable, highly scalable and high availability object storage. S3 was Amazon's first publicly available web service and provides storage through web service interfaces.</p>
<p>S3 supports objects of upto 5 TB in size. S3 organizes stored objects into buckets and within the scope of the bucket they are identified by unique keys. These keys are assigned by the user. Bucket and object creation and retrieval is possible using HTTP interfaces. Objects can also be downloaded using HTTP GET and BitTorrent protocol. S3 provides options to host static websites.</p>
<p>Requests are authorized using ACCESS_KEY_ID and SECRET_ACCESS_KEY associated with the AWS account. </p>
<p>Many companies like Pinterest, Dropbox, etc use S3 for their operations and backups.</p>
